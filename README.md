# CHMS Healthcare platform


In India, many private hospital chains maintain a database for their patients, but there is an absence of a central country wide system.

The inspiration for this project comes from the observation that in most developed economies, the citizen's healthcare data is stored by the government (a central authority) for access by healthcare professionals. For example, SSN (Social Security number) for Medicare/Medicaid program in the US.

The scope of our project is to emulate that system, on a much smaller (mini project) scale. 

To preserve the core functionality of the system we are trying to emulate, we have made an assumption that the entire population's Aadhar database is made available to us, since it is a GoI platform.
